# Project Description: Simple PlayStation Store Clone

I would like to introduce my frontend project aimed at creating a simple clone of the PlayStation Store. This project focuses on displaying game data using a mock API as a replacement for the official API. The project is developed using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for faster development.

## Key Features

- **Fetching API Data**: This project allows users to view a list of games fetched from a mock API. The game data includes information such as title, description, images, and prices.

- **Data Search**: There is a search feature that allows users to search for games based on title or other characteristics. This helps users find the games they are looking for more easily.

- **Loading Screen**: A loading screen has been implemented to enhance user experience while fetching data from the API. It provides feedback to users that the data is being loaded.

## Related Technologies

- **ReactJS**: Used as the primary framework for developing components and user interface interactions.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling and quickly structuring the project's appearance.

- **Vite**: Used as a development tool to enhance frontend development productivity.

## Motivation

## Future Contributions

I plan to continue developing this project by adding more features and improving its appearance and responsiveness. I am also open to feedback and contributions from the development community to enhance this project.
